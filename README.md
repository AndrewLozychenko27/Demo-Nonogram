# Nonogram

#### v 0.7

### by Andrii Lozychenko

This is my personal project designed to demonstrate my skills. I also use it to
learn and practice technologies and improve myself as a software engineer.

My project is based on the Japanese puzzle Nonogram, where you need to draw a picture “pixel by pixel” using clues.

## About project

The main idea of the project is to create a gaming space where players will have the opportunity to both create their
own puzzles
and play existing ones created in different ways - manually, generated by a pseudo-random generator
or by converting an uploaded picture.
